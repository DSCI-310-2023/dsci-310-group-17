DSCI 310: Teamwork Contract
Arman Moztarzadeh, Eric Liu, Ryan Lee, Matthew Gillies

## Expectations
The time expected for group members to work on DSCI 310 will be a maximum of 6 hours unless all the team members agree to lengthen the time expected. If team members cannot complete their sections within the maximum hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the group submission date (Saturday 6am) to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.
Meetings
Official meeting times were established during the initial team meeting held on 2023-01-31. Meetings will be held after DSCI 310 Lecture (Tues) weekly from 10:30am - 12:00pm. All members must notify if they are unable to attend at least 1 hourbefore.

## Communication
All communication outside of the meetings will be through Discord, Slack, or Github. Discord and Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Discord will also be used as our primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

## Reviews
All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate. Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.
Roles
There are two roles team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:
1. Scribe:
    - Responsible for taking notes at the meetings and in-class lab sessions and adding them as a GitHub issue.
    - Responsible for sharing all notes and in-class activities with teammates.
2. Proof-reader:
    - Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are met
    - Positions will be rotated each week to ensure that each team member does each position once.

## Deadlines
Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. The proofreader will review the work on Saturday and ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.

## Breach of Contract
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract is required by the member.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
